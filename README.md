### Hi there 👋

- I'm from Italy, currently working in a full-remote team.
- These days I mainly write code in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript (React).
- I'm the author of [Cloup](https://github.com/janluke/cloup), a library that extends Click with several features. From time to time, I contribute to Click as well.
